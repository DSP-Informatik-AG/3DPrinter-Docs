# Informatik AG 3D Printer Documentation

## Deploy locally

The documentation makes use of [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/#mkdocs), a static site generator for documentation. To deploy the documentation locally:

```
mkdocs serve
```

By default, the documentation should now be accessible from [localhost:8000](localhost:8000)

## Build

```

This will generate a website which can then be further deployed onto a web server.
